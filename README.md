### Intelligent System for Physical Exercise Evaluation

This project aims to develop an intelligent tool capable of analyzing, classifying, and evaluating the performance of physical exercises in real time using pose estimation techniques and machine learning models. The approach follows the CRISP-DM methodology and leverages libraries such as MediaPipe and datasets like MMFit. The goal is to contribute to the fields of physiotherapy and functional training by assessing key exercises and detecting possible errors in posture and movement.
